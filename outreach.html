            <h4>Instructor for: PHYS 210: Astronomy at UNK 2013</h4>
            <p>
              Astro 101 course that used the textbook The Essential Cosmic Perspectives by Bennett. This concept driven course
              covers
              topics from basic astronomy like the seasons, coordinate systems, and moon phases through advanced topics like
              stellar
              evolution, galaxy formation, and cosmology. My duties include developing the lecture, tests, in-class assignments,
              and
              homework.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Instructor for: PHYS 205: General Physics I at UNK 2013</h3>
            <p>
              This is the first semester of the algebra based physics sequence. We covered topics including: kinematics, dynamics,
              rotational motion, through waves. The course used the text Physics: Principles with Applications by Giancoli. My
              duties
              include developing the lecture, tests, in-class assignments, and homework.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Instructor for: PHYS 205L/275L: General Physics I Lab at UNK 2013</h3>
            <p>
              This laboratory class is designed to supplement both the algebra and calculus based introductory physics classes.
              The
              lab involves a brief lecture by me, and then the students break into groups to experience a different physical
              principal
              each week. The students worked out of a proprietary lab manual for UNK. I taught both versions of the lab: algebra
              and
              calculus based.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Instructor for: PHYS 100L: Physical Science Lab at UNK 2013</h3>
            <p>
              This laboratory class is designed to supplement our Physical Science lectures. We cover a variety of topics from
              kinematics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electricity, and optics. The lab involves a brief lecture by me, and then the
              students worked in groups on that week's lab. The students worked out of a proprietary lab manual for UNK.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Instructor for: ASTR 250: Undergraduate Seminar at Vanderbilt 2012 - 2013</h3>
            <p>
              ASTR 250 was an undergraduate seminar designed to teach students how to present scientific research in different
              settings. My job consisted of developing the course, lecturing, grading the presentations, and helping each student
              develop his or her presentations during office hours. I taught this class twice.
            </p>
          
            <h3>co-Lecturer for: ASTR 1010: Intro to Astronomy at Tenn. State July 2012</h3>
            <p>
              Astro 101 was a summer course that used the textbook The Cosmic Perspectives by Bennett. The class was composed of
              both
              lecture and lab. Another postdoc taught the first month, and I was the sole instructor of both the lecture and lab
              for
              the second month. This involved developing the course, writing and grading tests and homework, lecturing, and
              running
              labs
            </p>
          
            <h3>Substitute Lecturer for: Bridge Programming Boot Camp at Vanderbilt 2011</h3>
            <p>
              The Bridge program runs a programming bootcamp to bring new Vanderbilt graduate students up to speed on using Linux,
              Python, and IDL. I gave the lecture for the first week of this two week camp.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Substitute Lecturer for: AST 2037: Life in the Universe at UF 2009-201</h3>
            <p>
              AST 2037 was an Astro 101 course using the textbook The Search for Life in the Universe. I substitute-lectured
              roughly
              10 classes for both Dr. Ford and Dr. Ge combined. This was a large (approximately 100 student) class.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Co-Instructor: Dimensions summer camp: Astronomy at MSU June 2007</h3>
            <p>
              Dimensions was a summer camp for gifted middle school students. The class involved a combination of lecture and
              hands-on
              activities. Most of the activities came out of The Universe at Your Fingertips workbook.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Graduate TA: ISP 205 Astronomy Lab at MSU 2003-2004</h3>
            <p>
              ISP 205 was the standard freshman astronomy lab at Michigan state. It involved a brief lecture by me at the
              beginning of
              the lab, help during the lab, and grading of the final work. The students worked out of a proprietary lab manual for
              MSU.
            </p>
          
            <h2>Student Mentorship:</h2>
            <p>
              Part of my postdoctoral work at Vanderbilt has been as a Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge program postdoc. This program is
              specifically designed to increase the number of under-represented minorities in STEM graduate programs. Two of my
              primary roles in this have been as a research advisor to a 2nd year astronomy grad student and as an academic advisor to
              five 4th and 5th year STEM (astronomy, physics, and material science) graduate students. I have also mentored two REU
              students while at Vanderbilt.
            </p>
