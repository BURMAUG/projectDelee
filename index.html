            My name is Nathan De Lee, and I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Geology at Northern
            Kentucky University. I am also a adjunct professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Vanderbilt University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went to the University of Kansas for my undergraduate work majoring in both Physics and Astronomy. I worked with Bruce
            Twarog and Barbara Anthony-Twarog on metal rich open clusters. I went on to do my graduate work at Michigan State
            University working with Horace Smith and Timothy Beers. I worked on a number of projects including RR Lyrae stars and
            field horizontal branch stars. This work culminated in my thesis: RR Lyrae in the SDSS-II SN Survey. My first
            postdoctoral position was at the University of Florida working with Jian Ge on the MARVELS radial velocity exoplanet
            survey. My second postdoctoral position was at Vanderbilt University working with Keivan Stassun on MARVELS, LSST, KELT,
            and TESS surveys.
