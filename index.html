            <p>My name is Nathan De Lee, and I am currently an assistant
              professor in the Department of Physics and Geology at Northern Kentucky University.
              I am also a adjunct professor in the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/astro/">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a>
              at Vanderbilt University.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              I went to the University of Kansas for my undergraduate
              work majoring in both Physics and Astronomy.  I worked with Bruce
              Twarog and Barbara Anthony-Twarog on metal rich open clusters. I went
              on to do my graduate work at Michigan State University working with
              Horace Smith and Timothy Beers.  I worked on a number of projects
              including RR Lyrae stars and field horizontal branch stars.
              This work culminated in my thesis: RR Lyrae in the SDSS-II SN Survey.
              My first postdoctoral position was at the University of Florida working with
              Jian Ge on the MARVELS radial velocity exoplanet survey. My second postdoctoral
              position was at Vanderbilt University working with Keivan Stassun on MARVELS,
              LSST, KELT, and TESS surveys.
